  - *developed and tested against version `0.8.1`*
- [NSX](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/vmware/nsxt/latest) for NSX Edge-Cluster deployment, Logical Routing and Firewall configuration(s).
  - *developed and tested against version `3.6.0`*

## Improvements 🛠️

- VCF
  - **modules/vcf_bringup** - removed redundant naming of Resource Pools.
  
- NSX
  - **/modules/nsx_edge_cluster**
    - Removed legacy configurations and locals{} to support new provider realization features.
    - Transport-Zone configuration defaults to 'nsx-overlay-transportzone' unless specified (such as a VCF created one).
    - **/library/edge_cluster** - fixed destroy dependency mapping and policy churn errors, requiring multiple runs.

- LAB
  - **/modules/lab/nested_racks** - changed post configuration of nested ESXi VM templates.
  
## In Development 🏗️

Creating additional resources and templates for standardizing object/variable definitions to further develop the toolkit.

## Known Issues 🐞

- **VCF** | The provider currently is focused on VCF 4.5, but majority of functions work with 5.0 and 5.1.  Use at own risk and development for other versions.
