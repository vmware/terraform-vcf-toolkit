## Known Issues 🐞

- **LAB** | Content Library and Nested ESXI appliances broken for now due to Broadcom/VMware transition.  
  - See https://community.broadcom.com/developer-portal/discussion/nested-esxi-appliance-template-images for offline reworking.
  - https://community.broadcom.com/flings/home 
- **VCF** | The provider currently is focused on VCF 4.4+, but majority of functions work with 5.0 and 5.1.  Use at own risk and development for other versions.
